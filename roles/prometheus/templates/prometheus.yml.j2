# Prometheus configuration file
# Defines scraping rules and targets for Prometheus monitoring.
# This configuration works for both dev and prod environments.
# In dev, everything runs on one host; in prod, each Prometheus instance scrapes only its own node.

# Global configuration applied to all scrape jobs
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s  # How frequently Prometheus scrapes metrics

# Scrape job definitions
scrape_configs:

  # Scrape Prometheus' own metrics
  # In both dev and prod, this uses localhost because each Prometheus runs on its own machine
  - job_name: 'self-metrics'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9090']  # Self-scrape from Prometheus itself (default port)

  # Scrape node-exporter metrics (system metrics)
  # Each Prometheus instance scrapes the node-exporter on its own machine
  - job_name: 'node-exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']  # Metrics exposed by local node-exporter
